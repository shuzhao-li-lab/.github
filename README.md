# Computational Metabolomics
The Shuzhao Li lab at The The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (Connecticut) combine experimental approaches with computational algorithms that identify pathway patterns and integrate chemical reactions and biology. The high-resolution mass spectrometry measures the metabolome, lipidome and small molecules of dietary, microbial and environmental origins. This revolutionary information fills a major gap between genome and environment, with broad applications to diseases and precision medicine.
